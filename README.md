## Overview

This paper reatures an analysis of English Premier League teams rank and team wealth. The final `PDF` report ([link here](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/English_Premier_League_Economic_Predictors_on_League_Rank_2023-2024_Season/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf) analyzes the relationship between three explanatory variables: match attendance, total payroll, and market value, and teams total points accumulated during the English Premier League 2023-2024 season. Findings suggest that each explanatory variable significantly influences a team's league position (total points), highlighting the association between team success and team wealth.

## Statement on LLM usage

Code produced to conduct posterior predictive checks and diagnostics on the model used in this paper was written with the help of the ChatGPT. ChatGPT was used to check spelling errors, grammar errors, sentence structure etc. ChatGPT aided in creating my refernce list. The entire chat history is available in [other/llms/usage.txt](https://github.com/Bellamaclean7/English_Premier_League_Economic_Predictors_on_League_Rank_2023-2024_Season/blob/main/other/llm/usage.txt).
