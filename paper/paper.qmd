#| fig-cap: Figure 1 presents a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between total league points and average matchday attendance during the 2023-2024 season. Each point represents a team, plotted with their total points on the x-axis and their average home attendance on the y-axis. The trend line, added using linear regression analysis, suggests a correlation between team performance and matchday turnout. The correlation coefficient of 0.694060419947882 indicates a positive association with moderate correlation, where teams with higher league points tend to have greater average attendance.

#| label: fig-pts_vs_total_wage_bill
#| fig-cap: Figure 2 depicts the association between total league points and the total payroll for teams in the 2023-2024 season. Each point on the plot corresponds to a team, positioned according to their accumulated points for the season along the x-axis and their respective payroll on the y-axis. The linear regression trend line suggests a correlation between a teamâ€™s financial expenditure on payroll and their success in the league. A correlation coefficient of 0.770829037567151 reflects a positive relationship, implying that teams with higher payrolls may be more likely to accumulate greater league points.

cor_wages <- cor(analysis_data$pts, analysis_data$total_wage_bill, use = "complete.obs")

#| fig-cap: Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between teams total transfer spending and their corresponding league points for the 2023-2024 season. The scatter plot shows each team as a distinct point, positioned by their total league points on the x-axis and their transfer spending on the y-axis. The trend line, calculated with linear regression, indicates a moderate positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.417985956450557. This suggests that higher league points tend to coincide with increased transfer spending, although the relationship is not strongly linear.

#| label: fig-pts_vs_market_value
#| fig-cap: Figure 4 demonstrates the correlation between the current market value of teams and their accumulated league points for the 2023-2024 season. The scatter plot places each team by the total points they have secured on the x-axis against their market value on the y-axis. A pronounced upward trend represented by the linear regression line, with a correlation coefficient of 0.849962012423038, indicates a strong positive relationship. This suggests that teams with higher market values tend to amass more league points, underlining a potential link between financial strength and on-field success.
